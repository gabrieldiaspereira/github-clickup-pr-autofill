# github-clickup-pr-autofill

Gets the Task ID and Task Name from the Branch Name, fills the PR title with them, and assigns it to you.

It's a simple task, but I was tired of doing it manually.

## Installation

- Clone the repository.
- Go to your browser's extensions, you can access it in something like `your-browser-name://extensions/`
replacing your-browser-name, for example if you use brave it would be `brave://extensions/`.
- Activate developer mode.
- Click on "Upload without compression" and select the repository folder.<br>
Now you can create your PR and it will be filled in automatically :)
